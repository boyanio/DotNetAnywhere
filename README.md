# DotNetAnywhere

DotNetAnywhere (DNA) is a small interpreted .NET CIL runtime. The original [code](https://github.com/chrisdunelm/DotNetAnywhere) is adjusted by Steve Sanderson in his first versions of [Blazor](https://blazor.net). As he has replaced DNA with Mono, I decided to fork his [latest DNA version](https://github.com/SteveSanderson/Blazor/tree/150aeeb0965bd4b7a24412d239d836016c6b4238) in order to adjust it for the needs of my demo project [The Wheel of WebAssembly](https://github.com/boyanio/wasm-wheel).
